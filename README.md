## Enhanced SMTP by Kiwi Commerce

### Overview
- Delivering messages is an important and mandatory part of running an e-Commerce business. Magento sends hundreds and thousands of emails on daily basis. Reliability of the email sending process should be as stable as possible. All emails must be delivered to recipients without delays.
- Magento-based store owners often struggle when it comes to sending transactional emails. The default email server of inherent hosting will be used to send unregistered emails from unauthorized senders. These emails that are sent by default Magento 2, will probably end up in the Spam box. As a result, these emails cannot approach your customers.
- This extension lets you use any third-party SMTP server for your store and configure all the necessary settings to avoid this problem. You can use any reliable SMTP server to give your emails higher chances to be delivered directly to your customers.
- This extension includes pre-configured settings for 25+ most popular SMTP providers.
- This extension provides you with a feature to track all sent emails by inserting email log.
